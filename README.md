# jQuery App Creator

## About
This is a javaScript app which is used to initialize jQuery Apps. To create an app run <code>npm run create-app</code>. 
It will ask you some questions regarding your project and then it will create a folder with all the nesscery libraries such as jQuery.

### using the <code>App.json</code>

At the moment the <code>App.json</code> only takes two properties: 
use which is an array and takes in the libraries you want to include and default which takes your default workspace url.
Currently the use property only takes in two libraries which are jQuery UI and bootstrap.
to enter include these libraries type bt or bootstrap in lowercase for including bootstrap and use jqui or jquery_ui for including jQuery UI
